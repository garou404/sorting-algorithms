<h1>Sorting Algorithms in C</h1>
Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms in C project repository! This project is aimed at implementing various sorting algorithms in C.<br>The primary goals of this repository are:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Learning C Programming: serves as a practical exercise to become proficient in C.</li>
<li>Understanding Sorting Algorithms: deepen my understanding of their mechanics, complexities, and optimal use cases.</li>
<li>Exploring Data Structures: get a better understanding at the various data structures used in some of the algorithms.</li>
</ul>


Implemented Algorithms:

* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Tree Sort
* Bubble Sort
